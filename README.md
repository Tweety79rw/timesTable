Itâ€™s a number line with 200 points that is curved into a circle then for each point a line is draw from the point and the point number times the factor. So if on point 2 and factor of 2 a line is drawn from point 2 to point 4. If on point 3 and factor of 2 a line is drawn from point 2 to point 6. If on point 4 and factor of 2 a line is drawn from point 2 to point 8. And so on.
